# pi-paint VJ

Manual VJ rig for Raspberry Pi 5 + mini wireless keyboard + projector. A
standalone pygame app — it does not import from the rest of pi-paint, so
it can be lifted into its own repo at any time.

This is **Phase 1**: manual mode only, no audio. Phase 2 (aubio beat
detection + auto mode) and Phase 3 (Hailo person-matte) are planned but
not built yet.

## Quick start (no terminal needed)

On the Pi, open the file manager and navigate to this `vj/` folder.
Then double-click these files in order:

1. **`setup.sh`** — choose **"Execute in Terminal"** when prompted.
   Installs SDL2/OpenGL system libs, creates a Python virtualenv,
   installs pygame + opencv + numpy. Takes 2-5 minutes the first time.
   Safe to re-run; subsequent runs are a no-op.

2. Drop `.mp4` files into `assets/clips/` and `assets/overlays/` using
   the file manager (drag and drop works). See the READMEs in those
   folders for what to put there.

3. To launch, double-click one of these scripts and choose **"Execute"**:
   - **`Start VJ.sh`** — **dual display** (the main mode). Opens a
     control HUD on the small screen (display 0) showing live preview,
     current state, and the key cheat sheet; sends the visual output
     fullscreen to the projector (display 1).
   - **`Test (single screen).sh`** — both windows on the primary
     display, no fullscreen. Use this when no projector is connected.

4. (Optional) Double-click **`Install Desktop Shortcuts.sh`** to drop
   launcher icons on your desktop so you don't have to navigate into
   this folder every time.

### Display layout

The default `Start VJ.sh` assumes:

| Display index | Role          | What's shown                              |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `0` (primary) | Small screen  | Control HUD: preview, state, key map      |
| `1` (secondary) | Projector   | Fullscreen visual output                  |

If your displays are wired up the other way, open `Start VJ.sh` in a
text editor and swap `OUTPUT_DISPLAY` and `CONTROL_DISPLAY` at the top.

### Keyboard focus

The keyboard sends keys to whichever window has focus — click into the
**control HUD** window once when you start a set and leave it focused.
Mouse / trackpad XY (for tuning live FX) also reports relative to the
focused window, so if you hover over the HUD the FX will respond to
where your cursor is in the HUD. Hover over the output window instead
if you want the cursor position to map to the projected image.

### If "Execute" doesn't appear

Raspberry Pi OS file manager → **Edit → Preferences → General** →
turn ON **"Don't ask options on launch executable file"** (then a
single double-click runs them).

If that's not what you want, the dialog that pops up on double-click
has the right option — pick **"Execute"** for the Run scripts and
**"Execute in Terminal"** for setup so you can see install progress.

## Terminal install / launch (if you prefer)

```bash
cd vj
./setup.sh                                # same as the double-click

# Dual display — control HUD on display 0, fullscreen output on display 1
./venv/bin/python main.py --fullscreen --output-display 1 \
                          --control --control-display 0

# Single window, no HUD
./venv/bin/python main.py

# Bump rendered resolution
./venv/bin/python main.py --width 1280 --height 720 --fullscreen --output-display 1
```

## Keyboard map

The layout matches a standard QWERTY keyboard. Designed for the Tosuny /
Rii mini wireless keyboards (~70 keys + trackpad).

| Keys                | Action                                              |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0` | Pick base clip from `assets/clips/` (slot 1-10)   |
| `Q W E R T Y U I O P` | Toggle overlay from `assets/overlays/` (slot 1-10) |
| `A S D`             | Generative base: plasma / tunnel / starfield (toggle) |
| `Z`                 | HIT: strobe flash                                  |

| `F2`                | FX: horizontal mirror                              |
| `F3`                | FX: feedback / trails (mouse XY = zoom / rotate)   |
| `F4`                | FX: invert (persistent)                            |

| `F6`                | FX: edge detect                                    |
| `F7`                | FX: RGB split / chromatic aberration               |
| `Space`             | Blackout toggle (panic button)                     |
| `Backspace`         | Freeze frame toggle                                |
| `Esc`               | Kill all FX, overlays, hits — back to clean base   |
| `Shift+Esc`         | Quit                                               |
| **Trackpad XY**     | Controls active-FX parameters (kaleido segments, feedback zoom/rotate, etc.) |

Press a clip key (1-0) and a generative key (A/S/D) — last one wins.
Press an overlay key once to turn it on, again to turn it off.

Free libraries (download once, no internet needed at the party):

- **Base clips:** [Beeple VJ Loops](https://www.beeple-crap.com/vjloops),
  [Mantissa CC0 4K](https://mantissa.xyz/vj.html),
  [Videezy VJ Loops](https://www.videezy.com/free-video/vj-loop)

  [Videezy Spark Overlays](https://www.videezy.com/free-video/spark-overlay),
  [Vecteezy Sparks](https://www.vecteezy.com/free-videos/sparks-overlay)

For overlays: pick footage that's already pre-keyed against a **black**
background. The compositor uses screen-blend, so anything bright pops
through and the black drops out. Don't bother with true alpha-channel
video on Pi — the hardware decoder doesn't like it.

Recommended pre-processing (one-time, on a desktop):

```bash
# Downsample to projector resolution + re-encode to H.264 for hardware decode
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf scale=854:480 -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 22 -an output.mp4
```

## Architecture

```
main.py        argparse + pygame init + main loop wiring; opens the
               output window via pygame.display + a second SDL2
               Window+Renderer for the control HUD
engine.py      Engine class: state, render pipeline, public actions.
               Splits compose_frame() (numpy) from blit_to_output()
               (pygame) so the same frame can feed both windows.
control.py     ControlWindow: preview, state badges, cached key
               cheat sheet. Renders to an offscreen Surface and
               uploads as a Texture each frame.
effects.py     Generative + transformative numpy/OpenCV effects
clips.py       ClipPool: lazy MP4 loader keyed by slot index
keymap.py      Pygame key → engine action dispatch table
config.py      Config dataclass
```

Render pipeline each frame:

```
base layer   →  active clip OR active generative OR black
   ↓
FX chain     →  kaleido, mirror, rgb_split, posterize, edges, invert, feedback
   ↓
overlay      →  screen-blend the active overlay clip
   ↓
hits         →  transient strobe/flash/punch (5 frames)
   ↓
blit to pygame screen
```

`prev_frame` is captured before the next render so feedback works.

## Performance notes

- Targets 30 fps at 854×480 on Pi 5. Generatives are vectorized numpy.
- `kaleidoscope` is the heaviest effect (per-pixel remap). Stack 2-3
  effects max for headroom.
- MP4 decode uses OpenCV's `VideoCapture` — relies on libavcodec; on
  Pi 5 it does software H.264 decode but stays well under a frame budget
  for 854×480.
- Clip frames are read **once per render**, so don't try to play more
  than one clip slot simultaneously — only the most recently selected
  base and overlay are advanced.

## Not yet built (Phase 2/3)

- **Auto mode:** aubio beat detector listening on a USB mic, scenes
  swap on downbeats, hits fire on kick onsets, FX intensity scales
  with smoothed RMS energy.
- **Hailo person matte:** silhouette the dancer/DJ from the webcam,
  composite over the base — fire and lasers "shoot from hands."
- **Pre-baked Shadertoy MP4s:** bake favorite shaders offline to
  854×480 H.264 loops so the rig can play them back without live GLSL.
